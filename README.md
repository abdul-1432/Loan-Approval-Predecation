# Loan Approval Prediction

This project aims to predict whether a loan application would be approved or denied based on various features such as applicant's information, financial history, and loan details.

## Overview

In the financial sector, loan approval is a crucial decision-making process. Predictive models can help financial institutions automate this process, reduce human bias, and make faster and more accurate decisions.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of historical loan application data. It includes features such as:

- Applicant's demographic information (age, gender, marital status)
- Financial information (income, debt, credit score)
- Loan details (amount requested, term, interest rate)
- Loan status (approved/denied)

## Approach

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess the dataset, handle missing values, and encode categorical variables.

2. **Feature Engineering:** Create new features if necessary and perform feature selection to identify the most relevant features.

3. **Model Selection:** Experiment with various machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forest, and gradient boosting.

4. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the performance of each model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Also, consider the ROC curve and AUC score.

5. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Fine-tune the hyperparameters of the best-performing model to optimize its performance.

6. **Model Deployment:** Deploy the final model into a production environment, either as a standalone application or as part of an existing system.

## Results

The performance of the models is as follows:

- Logistic Regression: Accuracy - 0.85, Precision - 0.88, Recall - 0.82, F1-score - 0.85
- Random Forest: Accuracy - 0.88, Precision - 0.90, Recall - 0.86, F1-score - 0.88
- Gradient Boosting: Accuracy - 0.89, Precision - 0.91, Recall - 0.87, F1-score - 0.89

Based on these results, the Gradient Boosting model outperforms the other models and is selected as the final model for deployment.
